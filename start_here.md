Getting going gwith git!
========================

0. Take 5 minutes and 58 seconds to watch a video about git (https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)
1. Install git on your machine (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
 - Make sure to configure your git account info for github (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git)
2. Go to github and create a new repository in your account (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)
3. Get a copy of the new repository from github's servers onto your local machine (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
4. Go into your repository on your local machine and create a README file that just says "Hello Git!"
5. Share this new file by "pushing" your local changes to the repository up to github (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-from-the-command-line/)
6. Go to your repository on github and take a look at the changes (https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-commit-views/)
